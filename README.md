# Continue on PC

A feature similar to Microsoft's Continue On PC for any system with python3 installed. Ever had someone text you a link to a video or article when you are infront of your computer and you want to open it on your PC but don't want to google for it? I had that experience and this is my solution

### Prerequisites

An android phone and a PC able to run python.

## Installation

Clone this repository and change the IP in the ```python_server.py``` to your IP. Run the ```python_server.py```. Install the apk. The path to apk is ```./app/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk```. Open the app, type in your IP and click Connect. Now you're good to go.

### Usage

Use the share feature in any app and choose Continue on PC. Your web browser should then open your required page.
