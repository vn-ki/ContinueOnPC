# Continue on PC

A feature similar to Microsoft's Continue On PC for any system with python3 installed. Ever had someone text you a link to a video or article when you are infront of your computer and you want to open it on your PC but don't want to google for it? I had that experience and this is my solution. It also has the ability to unlock your computer if you happen to run gnome or kde.

### Prerequisites

An android phone and a PC able to run python.

## Installation

Clone this repository and change the IP in the ```python_server.py``` to your IP and add a password in the password string. . Install the apk. The path to apk is ```./app/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk```. 

### Usage
Run the ```python_server.py``` on your pc. Open the app, type in your IP and password and click Connect/Unlock. Now you're good to go. You need to type you're password only once. 
Use the share feature in any app and choose Continue on PC. Your web browser should then open your required page.
If you want to unlock your pc, open the app and click Connect/Unlock. Please make sure that the password and IP fields are empty.
